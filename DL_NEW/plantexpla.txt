his code is a TensorFlow/Keras implementation for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify potato leaf images into three classes: 'Early_Blight', 'Healthy', and 'Late_Blight'. Let's break down the code step by step:

Importing Libraries:
TensorFlow (import tensorflow as tf): Deep learning library.
TensorFlow's Keras API (from tensorflow.keras import layers): High-level API for building and training models.
Matplotlib (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt): Plotting library.
NumPy (import numpy as np): Library for numerical computations.
Pandas (import pandas as pd): Library for data manipulation.
Loading the Dataset:
The dataset consists of images of potato leaves with three classes: Early Blight, Healthy, and Late Blight.
The tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory function is used to load the dataset from directories.
Three datasets are loaded: training, testing, and validation, each with different numbers of images belonging to the three classes.
Data Exploration:
class_names: Extracts the class names from the training dataset.
Visualization: Plots a sample of images from the training dataset along with their corresponding class names.
Data Preprocessing:
Data is preprocessed and prepared for training:
resize_scale: Sequential model to resize images to (IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE) and rescale pixel values to [0, 1].
data_augmentation: Sequential model to apply random flips and rotations for data augmentation.
input_shape: Defines the input shape for the model.
Model Building:
tf.keras.Sequential: Defines a sequential model.
Layers:
Resizing and rescaling layers for preprocessing.
Convolutional layers with ReLU activation followed by max-pooling layers.
Flatten layer to convert 2D output to 1D.
Dense layers with ReLU activation for classification.
Output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.
Model Compilation:
Configures the model for training:
Optimizer: Adam optimizer.
Loss function: Sparse categorical crossentropy.
Metrics: Accuracy for evaluation.
Model Training:
model.fit: Trains the model on the training data.
Epochs: 5
Batch size: 32
Verbose: Prints training progress.
Validation data: Validation dataset for monitoring performance during training.
Model Evaluation:
model.evaluate: Evaluates the model on the testing data.
Computes test loss and accuracy.
Prints and stores the test accuracy.
